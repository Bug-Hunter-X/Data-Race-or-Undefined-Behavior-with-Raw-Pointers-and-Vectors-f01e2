This repository contains a Rust code example that illustrates a potential data race or undefined behavior when manipulating a vector using raw pointers.  The `bug.rs` file shows the unsafe code, while `bugSolution.rs` demonstrates a safer, more idiomatic way to achieve the desired outcome.  This example highlights the importance of safe memory management in Rust and the risks associated with unsafe code blocks.  Always strive to avoid using raw pointers whenever possible and favor safe, concurrent data structures provided by the Rust standard library.
